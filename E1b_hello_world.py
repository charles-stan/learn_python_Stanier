Hello World Python Script
Learning Example for Dr. Stanier's classes

Written/Tested In: Python 3.7.3

Program Objective: Build on the previous example, but this time use a void function in addition to the python print function.  Our function will add exclamation points before and after the string of characters that is passed to it.  
This has limited functional purpose â€“ it is mainly to show the syntax for creating a void function, and giving an example of its use.  


Modifications: none so far

# normally we would start with importing libraries but this script does not require any

# next we put our function definitions for functions that we will be calling in the script
# document each function like you would a script (name, email, date, purpose, modifications)
